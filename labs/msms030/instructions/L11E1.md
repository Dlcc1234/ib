# Module 10 - Lab 11 - Exercise 1 - Creating Sensitivity Labels
Adatum has transitioned to Microsoft 365 as its enterprise cloud solution. The company has been awarded several government contracts which work heavily with sensitive and classified products.  
In your role as Holly Dickson, Adatum’s Enterprise Administrator, the company CTO has requested that you devise a solution for encrypting and securing messages when working in these related contracts. He has also requested that any references to “Project New Day” be automatically encrypted. This is a top-secret project, and it is imperative that no mention of this project be leaked outside the company.  
In this lab, you will address your CTO's request by creating sensitivity labels that will be used for creating label policies. You will create sensitivity labels using the Microsoft 365 Compliance center as well as Windows PowerShell. While still satisfying your CTO's request, this plan will provide you with experience using each method as part of your pilot project. This way, you can later decide which approach you prefer when you transition from your pilot phase to the production phase. With your labels in place, you will then create a label policy - again, using both the Compliance center and PowerShell.  
>**Important:** Sensitivity labels and policies can take up to 24 hours to propagate through the system and update the back-end servers. Unfortunately, with this training course nearing its end, you will not have time to verify your work by testing the labels and policies you created. However, it is hoped that this lab exercise will still provide you with experience and insight into the mechanics of creating sensitivity labels and policies, even though you cannot test them.

### Task 1 - Creating a test team
In your role as Holly Dickson, you will create a new Microsoft 365 group titled PND Group (for Project New Day, the name of which you want to avoid circulating through the company) that will be used as part of your sensitivity label testing in the upcoming tasks.
1. In **LON-CL1**, you should still be logged in as the **Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.
1. At the end of the prior lab, you logged out of Microsoft 365 as the MOD Administrator and closed Edge. Select the **Edge** icon on the taskbar and then enter the following URL in the address bar: **https://portal.office.com**.
1. In the **Pick an account** window, select **Holly Dickson** at **holly@xxx.onmicrosoft.com** (where xxx is your tenant ID) and enter **ibForm@tion** as her password.
1. On the **Microsoft 365** homepage select **Admin**.
1. On the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, in the left-hand navigation pane select **Teams & groups**, and then select **Active teams & groups**.
1. In the **Active teams & groups** window, select **Add a group** on the menu bar at the top of the page.
1. In the **Choose a group type** pane that appears, the **Microsoft 365 (recommended)** group type is selected by default. Accept this value by selecting **Next**.
1. In the **Set up the basics** window, enter **PND Group** in the **Name** field and **Group used for sensitivity label testing** in the **Description field** and then select **Next** (Note - if you leave the **Description** field blank, you must still select it to enable the **Next** button).
1. In the **Assign owners** window, select **+ Assign owners**, enter your global administrator name in the **Search for a name or email address** field, which will display the list of active users. Select your global administrator and then select **Add (1)**. When your administrator is listed, select **Next**.
1. In the **Add members** windows, select **+ Add members**. In the list of users, it may be easier to enter the first few characters of each user's first name in the Search field rather than scrolling through the list of all on-premises users that were synchronized to Microsoft 365 in the earlier directory synchronization lab.
	Select **Isaiah Langer**, **Sherri Harrell**, and **Nona Snider** and then select **Add (3)**, and then select **Next**.
1. In the **Edit settings** window, enter **PNDgroup** in the **Group email address** field.  
	**Note:** To the right of the **Group email address** field is the domain field. This is different from adding users in that no other domains appear; therefore, you must leave this value as is.  
	After configuring this field, the PND Group email address should appear as: **PNDgroup@xxxUPNxxx**  
	After configuring the email address, under the **Privacy** section, select **Private**, and leave the check box selected to **Create a team for this group**. Select **Next**.
1. On the **Review and finish adding group** window, review the information and if anything needs to be changed, select the appropriate **Edit** option; otherwise, select the **Create group** button at the bottom of the page.
1. On the **PND Group group created** window, note the message that appears at the top of the page that indicates it may take up to 5 minutes before the group appears in the list of active groups. Select **Close**
1. On the **Active teams and groups** window, select **Refresh** on the menu bar to refresh the list of active groups. You may have to wait a few minutes and refresh again. Once the **PND Group** group appears in the list, select the group line.
1. For security purposes, you have decided to add Elvis Cress as an additional owner of this group. In the **PND Group** pane that appears, the **General** tab is displayed by default. Select the **Membership** tab. 
1. In the **Membership** tab, in the **Owners** section, select **+ Add owners**. This displays an **Add team owners to PND Group** pane.
1. In the Search field, enter **Elvis**, select **Elvis Cress**, and then select **Add (1)**.
1. On the **PND Group** window, select the **X** in the upper right-hand corner to close the window.
1. Leave your Edge browser and all its tabs open and proceed to the next task.
