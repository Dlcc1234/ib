# Module 6 - Lab 7 - Exercise 3 - Configuring client access policies
Outlook on the web enables Adatum's users to access their mailboxes through a web browser. After Adatum created its Microsoft 365 tenant with Exchange Online, the tenant included a single Outlook Web App policy titled OWAMailboxPolicy-Default. This policy defines Outlook on the web settings for all users. However, Holly Dickson, Adatum's Enterprise Admin, wants to create an additional Outlook on the web policy that applies to a specific user (in this case, Patti Fernandez). By verifying whether a user-specific policy such as this works, Holly will be able to vary the Outlook on the web settings for users with different needs.  
Holly will then configure a mailbox policy for mobile devices that requires a password and sets the parameter for password length. Holly will then create a mobile device access policy that places any new devices into quarantine, at which point the device must be approved to be removed from quarantine so that it can send and receive messages.

## Task 1: Configure an Outlook Web App policy
1. You should still be logged into LON-CL1 as the **Administrator** with a password of **Pa55w.rd**.
1. Your Edge browser should be open from the prior exercise, with tabs open for the **Microsoft 365** homepage, the **Microsoft 365 admin center**, and the **Exchange admin center**. You should still be signed into Microsoft 365 as Holly Dickson.  
	If you closed the Exchange admin center tab after the prior lab exercise, then in the **Microsoft 365 Admin center**, under **Admin Centers** in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Exchange**.
1. In the **Exchange admin center** tab, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **Other features** .
1. On the **Other features** page, Select the **Current Location** link on the **OWA policy** line.
1. On the the **Outlook Web App policies** tab, note the existing Outlook Web App policy titled **OWAMailboxPolicy-Default**. This policy defines Outlook on the web settings for all users.  
	Since Holly wants to add a new policy, select the **+** icon on the menu bar. 
1. In the **new Outlook Web App mailbox policy** window, enter **Limited features** in the **Policy name** field. Note - This policy is titled **Limited features** since it reduces the number of features that will be enabled for the policy.
1. The window displays a list of features that will be enabled for this Outlook Web App mailbox policy. The majority of these features are selected by default. Clear the check boxes for the following features that Holly does not want included in this custom policy:  
	- **Instant messaging**
	- **Text messaging**
	- **LinkedIn contact sync**
	- **Journaling**
1. At the bottom of the window, under **Private computer or OWA for devices**, clear the **Direct file access** check box, select **Save**, and then select **OK** once the information has been successfully saved.
1. Stay in the classic **Exchange admin center** and, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **recipients**.
1. On the **recipients** page, the **mailboxes** tab at the top of the page is displayed by default. In the list of user mailboxes, select **Nona Snider** and then select the **pencil**(Edit) icon on the menu bar.
1. In the **Nona Snider** window, in the left-hand navigation pane, select **mailbox features**.
